# 2nd City Zoning

2nd City Zoning is an interactive map that lets you:

-   find out **how your building is zoned**
-   learn **where to locate your business**
-   explore **zoning patterns** throughout the city

To make Chicago’s zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration
from one of our favorite games: [Sim City 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000). It started with the color scheme and from there we got a little carried away. Graphics, sounds, music, oh my.

2nd City Zoning is entirely [open
source](http://secondcityzoning.org/about#code) and built with [open data](http://secondcityzoning.org/about#data).

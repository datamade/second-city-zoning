    <h4 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h4>
    <p>2nd City Zoning is an interactive map that lets you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        find out
        <strong>how your building is zoned</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        learn
        <strong>where to locate your business</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        explore
        <strong>zoning patterns</strong>
        throughout the city
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To make Chicago's zoning code digestible by humans, we took inspiration
      from one of our favorite games:
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000">Sim City 2000</a>. It
      started with the color scheme:
      <strong style="color: #7dd67d">green</strong>
      for residential,
      <strong style="color: #7474d7">blue</strong>
      for commercial and
      <strong style="color: #dcdc7f">yellow</strong>
      for industrial. (This oversimplifies things a bit,
      <a href="/about#zoning-categories">read the full story</a>.) From there we
      got a little carried away. Graphics, sounds, music, oh my.
    </p>
    <p>
      2nd City Zoning is entirely
      <a href="#code">open source</a>
      and built with
      <a href="#data">open data</a>.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h4 id="what-is-zoning">What is zoning?</h4>
    <p>Zoning basically makes sure a factory doesn't open next to a school.</p>
    <p>
      It consists of
      <a
        href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicagozoning_il/0-0-0-48006"
        >regulations</a
      >
      that control how big of a building you can build on a property, what you
      can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere - every property
      in Chicago lives in a zoning district of one kind or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      These districts shape the physical character and economic makeup of our
      neighborhoods. They're the DNA of our city's build environment: some
      districts allow high rises to sprout around downtown, others encourage
      walkable, mixed-use commercial corridors on arterial streets, and still
      others insulate the city's lingering industrial corridors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoning is controlled by Chicago's
      <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html"
        >City Council</a
      >. They have a
      <a
        href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/zoning_board_of_appeals.html"
        >Zoning Board</a
      >
      that reviews all proposed zoning changes, which are then passed on to a
      City Council vote. Unlike most cities, each zoning change, when approved,
      is put down in the books as a
      <strong>separate ordinance</strong>.
      <a
        href="http://chicago.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1222600&amp;GUID=95D948AE-2AF6-4D85-95CC-AE7AD0F403F6&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search="
        >Here's an example of one</a
      >.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4 id="how-does-zoning-work">How do zoning districts work?</h4>
    <p>
      All properties in Chicago fall within a zoning district. These districts
      are grouped into
      <a href="">broad categories</a>
      like Residential and Manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every zoning district has a designation (in 'land use-density' format,) a
      name, and a description. Let's look at an example:
    </p>
    <div class="well">
      <h5>B1-1: Neighborhood Shopping District</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>What's here?</strong>
        Retail storefronts on low-traffic streets. Apartments allowed above the
        ground floor.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Remember, zoning is about land use - what you can do with a property - and
      density - how big the building can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "B1" piece of this district's designation captures the
      <strong>land use</strong>
      part. The zoning ordinance lists in excrutiating detail every business
      that is and isn't allow in a B1 district. Its official official name is a
      "Neighborhood Shopping District," and we distilled the description of what
      goes on there from the zoning ordinance. (No need to thank us.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, the B1 designation starts with the letter "B" because it falls
      under the
      <a href="http://secondcityzoning.org/zones#B">Business category</a>
      of zoning districts, which also contains Neighborhood Mixed-Use (B2) and
      Community Shopping (B3) districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "-1" bit of the designation captures the
      <strong>density</strong>
      part. In zoning, there are a bunch of rules ("density and bulk
      requirements," in zoning-speak) that restrict how big a building you can
      build on a property - titillating things like maximum height requirements,
      floor-area ratios, and others. (They're all explained
      <a href="http://secondcityzoning.org/zoning_rules">here</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The larger the number after the hyphen, the denser the buildings can be.
      In all, there are five flavors of B1 district, B1-1 through B1-5. They all
      allow exactly the same land uses, but you can building denser buildings in
      B1-3 and B1-5 districts than in B1-1. This "land use-density" designation
      pattern applies to all districts.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4 id="how-does-zoning-get-changed">How does zoning get changed?</h4>
    <p>
      Zoning changes must be aprroved by City Council and can be proposed in two
      ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          As a
          <a
            href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/provdrs/admin/svcs/zoning_amendments.html"
            >Zoning Reclassification Application</a
          >
          with no Aldermanic sponsor, requiring financial and personal
          disclosures, along with submitted architecture drawings and a
          non-refundable fee of $1,025.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's
          <a href="https://chicago.councilmatic.org/legislation/o-2013-4170/"
            >an example</a
          >
          of one of these applications.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As an ordinance sponsored by an Alderman, consisting of a few
          sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example of a re-classification at
          <a href="https://chicago.councilmatic.org/legislation/so-2012-5679/"
            >1511-1553 W Division St and 1141 N Ashland Ave</a
          >
          sponsored by Alderman Proco Joe Moreno.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In Chicago, aldermen have long controlled most zoning decisions, giving
      them significant sway over the shape and evolution of neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been over 2,300 zoning reclassifications in Chicago since 2011.

    <hr />
    <h4 id="zoning-categories">What are the different zoning categories?</h4>
    <p>
      In Chicago, all districts fall within one of twelve broad zoning
      categories, explained below. To learn more about a particular district,
      visit the
      <a href="/zones">zoning districts page</a>
      or read the
      <a
        href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicagozoning_il/0-0-0-48006"
        >City of Chicago Zoning Ordinance</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#R">
        <img alt="Residential" src="/assets/images/icons/residential.png" />
        Residential (R)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Houses and apartment buildings only on these parcels! No stores, offices,
      or factories allowed. Schools, churches, police stations and the like are
      cool, though.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#B">
        <img alt="Commercial" src="/assets/images/icons/commercial.png" />
        Business (B)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      From bodegas to big boxes, these districts are for stores and offices. B
      districts promote walkable storefronts and shopping centers. To promote
      mix-use neighborhoods, above-ground floor apartments are usually cool.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#C">
        <img alt="Commercial" src="/assets/images/icons/commercial.png" />
        Commercial (C)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      C districts are also geared towards commerce, but allow a wider variety of
      businesses than B districts, especially car-oriented stuff like strip
      malls and drive-through banks. Above-ground floor apartments are usually
      still okay.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#D">
        <img alt="Commercial" src="/assets/images/icons/commercial-residential.png" />
        Downtown (D)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Downtown zoning districts can only be found in the Loop and its environs.
      They're what makes it legal to build high-rise offices and apartments
      downtown. Weirdly, the Downtown Service (DS) districts in this category
      also cover the South Loop warehouse area between the Dan Ryan and the
      Chicago River.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#M">
        <img alt="Manufacturing" src="/assets/images/icons/industrial.png" />
        Manufacturing (M)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Factories, warehouses, freight, junkyards... all the heavy duty stuff that
      still litters Chicago's industrial corridors. These districts range from
      nondescript warehouses (M1) to hardcore factories (M3).
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#PMD">
        <img alt="Manufacturing" src="/assets/images/icons/industrial.png" />
        Planned manufacturing districts (PMD)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Fourteen special zoning districts that protect industry from encroachment
      by commercial and residential buildings. Unlike other districts, parcels
      in PMDs cannot be rezoned to non-industrial uses, so they take zoning
      decisions out of aldermens' hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1988, the Harold Washington administration created the Clybourn
      Corridor, the city's first PMD, and Daley continued the policy. For an
      evaluation of whether the PMD's have actually kept industrial jobs in
      Chicago, see Joel Rast's article "
      <a href="https://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/pmdstudy1.pdf"
        >Curbing Industrial Decline or Thwarting Redevelopment?</a
      >
      "
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#PD">
        <img alt="Planned Development" src="/assets/images/icons/government.png" />
        Planned development (PD)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Tall buildings, hospital campuses, and other large developments that must
      be negotiated with city planners. Developers gain freedom in building
      design (read: they can bend the zoning rules,) but must work with city to
      ensure projects gel with and benefit the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#T">
        <img alt="Planned Development" src="/assets/images/icons/trains.png" />
        Transportation district (T)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Bits of land designed to protect roads, bus ways, bike trails, and rail
      lines. Only a handful of properties in town are zoned this way.
    </p>
    <h5>
      <a href="/zones#POS">
        <img
          alt="Parks and Open Space"
          src="/assets/images/icons/parks-entertainment.png"
        />
        Parks and Open Space (POS)
      </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Protects land set side for public parks, open space, beaches, and
      cemeteries. Most Chicago Park District land lives in these districts.
      Also, this is what keeps the lakefront forever open, free, and clear.

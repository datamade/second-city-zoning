title: Zoning districts
description: "Zoning basically makes sure a factory doesn't open next to a school. It consists of regulations that control how big of a building you can build on a property, what you can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere - every property in Chicago lives in a zoning district of one kind or another."

          <strong>What is zoning?</strong>
          Zoning basically makes sure a factory doesn't open next to a school.
        </p>
        <p>
          It consists of
          <a href='https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicagozoning_il/0-0-0-48006'>regulations</a>
          that control how big of a building you can build on a property,
          what you can do inside it. You can't just build anything anywhere -
          every property in Chicago lives in a zoning district of one kind or another.
